Front-End of Parzi developed with React-Native

What it does
For our core value, user can use our mobile application to search available parking spots within user defined range. While user is parking their car, the parking spot can automatically recognise userâ€™s car plate number. The user get to choose which online payment method their want to use and how long their want to park their car there.

How I built it
Car plate number recognition is implemented by using Raspberry Pi with camera and computer vision algorithm. React-Native is be used to implement our mobile application, our back end server is implemented by Django framework and sqlite as database.

Challenges I ran into
HardWare: Car plate recognition. BackEnd: smoothly communicate with front end and hardware part Interchange information between front end and hardware part Front end: Balance between UI design and performance.
